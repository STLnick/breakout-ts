# breakout-ts
My attempt at the classic game Breakout from scratch using TypeScript.

## Why I'm building it
My goal is to learn more about TypeScript and work without a framework to also work more directly with the Web APIs.

Also Breakout is really fun! I'm starting my exploration of some super basic game developement - a curiousity I've been kicking around for a while now.
