# breakout-ts
My attempt at the classic game Breakout from scratch using TypeScript.

## Why I'm building it
My goal is to learn more about TypeScript and work without a framework to also work more directly with the Web APIs.

Also Breakout is really fun! I'm starting my exploration of some super basic game developement - a curiousity I've been kicking around for a while now.

## Project Setup with Vite
Started with `npm create vite@latest breakout-ts -- --template vanilla-ts` - deleted most of everything and added the most basic display to start for the initial commit.
